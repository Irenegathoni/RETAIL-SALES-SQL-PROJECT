# Retail Sales SQL Project

This project explores sales data from a fictional retail store.  
The goal was to practice beginner-level SQL while answering common business questions using one simple table.

## About the Project

The dataset includes customer purchases, product categories, payment methods, order dates, and amounts.  
I created the data manually and structured everything in a single table called `RetailTb`.

All queries were written using basic SQL concepts I’ve recently been learning:
- Filtering with `WHERE`, `BETWEEN`, and `IN`
- Aggregation using `COUNT()` and `SUM()`
- Grouping with `GROUP BY` and filtering with `HAVING`
- Sorting using `ORDER BY`

No joins were used , this was intentional so I could focus on core querying skills before moving to multi-table relationships.

## Business Questions Answered

Some of the key questions I explored:
- Which payment method was used the most?
- What’s the total revenue per product category?
- Are customers spending more through Card or Mpesa?
- Which days had the most orders?
- What’s the total order amount per payment method?

## Files in This Repo

- `Retail_Analysis.sql`: Contains the table creation, data insertion, and all queries

## Why I Did This

This project helped me build confidence in writing and reading SQL.  
It also pushed me to start publishing my work publicly ,something I used to overthink.
